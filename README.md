Project Name
Norwegian Social Security Base Amount Analytics Tool

Description
The program downloads, processes and analyzes the Norwegian social security base amounts (G). 
The base amount is used to calculate maximum pensionable income, and the limits for occupational pension contributions.
The frequency and the size of the increases have varied since the Norwegian social security scheme was introduced in 1967. 
Because of the importance of the base amounts, it's useful to process and analyze these numbers to be used in pension calculations etc.
